Background: 
Skin microbiome plays a significant role in the healing process of burn wounds. However, how this process occurs and how different microbes contribute to the healing are not understood. Additionally, burn wounds and subsequent treatments induce systematic response in the body. Hence, microbiomes at other body sites, such as the gut microbiome, are also worth studying.

Goal of paper: 
To collect preliminary data on the longitudinal profiles of microbial communities at burn wounds, spared skin, and gut.

Experimental design: 
Severely burned patients had their microbiomes sampled on 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 days post admission to the hospital. Samples were collected at four sites: burn wound, spared skin at corresponding area, rectal area, perianal area.

Questions to answer through this analysis:
1. How do microbial communities at burn wounds vs. spared skin differ?
2. How do these bacterial populations change over time?
3. How are gut microbial communities altered over the days post admission?

Sequencing methods:
V3–V4 hypervariable region of the 16srRNA is sequenced through Illumina MiSeq v3 chemistry with 300-bp paired end.
